- Error Handling Best Practices:

  - Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions using guard clauses
  - Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deeply nested if statements
  - Place the happy path last in the function for improved readability
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead
  - Implement proper error logging with structured data for debugging
  - Use custom error types with meaningful names and messages
  - Provide user-friendly error messages in the UI layer

- Server-Side Error Handling:

  - Use next-safe-action for type-safe server actions with Zod validation
  - Model expected errors as return values in Server Actions
  - Implement error boundaries using error.tsx and global-error.tsx
  - Use the Error component from next/error for 404 and 500 errors
  - Implement proper error logging with context for server-side errors

- Client-Side Error Handling:

  - Use React Error Boundary components for catching rendering errors
  - Implement fallback UI components for error states
  - Use try-catch blocks only for unexpected runtime errors
  - Handle async errors with proper loading and error states
  - Use React.Suspense for handling loading states

- Form Validation:

  - Use Zod for type-safe form validation
  - Implement client-side validation before submission
  - Use server-side validation as a security measure
  - Provide immediate feedback for validation errors
  - Use proper ARIA attributes for accessibility
  - Handle all form submission edge cases

- API Error Handling:

  - Use proper HTTP status codes for different error types
  - Implement consistent error response format
  - Handle network errors and timeouts gracefully
  - Provide retry mechanisms for transient failures
  - Log API errors with relevant context for debugging

- Error Monitoring and Reporting:
  - Implement proper error tracking and monitoring
  - Use structured logging for better error analysis
  - Include relevant context in error reports
  - Handle errors in development vs production differently
  - Implement rate limiting for error reporting
  - Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern instead.
  - Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
  - Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
  - Consider using custom error types or error factories for consistent error handling.
